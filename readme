Deployment of server

1. Make sure the system has Node.js installed. If the system doesn't have Node.js installed, download latest version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/ and install.

2. Make sure Node is installed by a simple command node -v or npm -v which gives the versions for Node and npm package manager.

3. Next, Clone the project repository in to the system.

4. Go to terminal (or Command prompt) and navigate to the project folder.

5. Enter the command, npm install --save. This is going to create a "node_modules" folder inside the project repository and download the required libraries that are used in the project. 

6. Now, Run the server using the command node server.js -args

Where, args is a list of arguments passed to the server instance in the following order

port name: Name of the port to which the arduino is connected.

i, j, k : Respective coordinates of ACE1, ACE2, ACE 3

So, the sample command might look like node server.js /dev/cu.usbmodem1411 12 6 12.

7. After Firing the server, go to browser and enter the following address,

	For test screen: http://localhost:8000/
	For the map layout and and navigation: http://localhost:8000/demo
